# VR Desk

----
## What is VR Desk?
This is an experiment to use WebVR to render a programming set up. The idea is to feature several monitors, running a browser-based version of Vim. In addition to that, StackOverflow will appear on one of the monitors. All of these are rendered as iframes with a CSS3DRenderer inside of ThreeJS. Currently, it's showing one monitor with my website [ryansworks.com](ryansworks.com) 

**I need help with this, I can't render the iframe properly in Firefox Nightly. In direct-to-Rift mode the iframe appears skewed across the screen and it doesn't appear as it would in normal WebGL mode. I would love help!**

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. In the repo directory, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
3. Open a WebVR browser, such as Firefox Nightly, and visit`localhost:8000`
